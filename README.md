## Getting Started

Easy version: Run the next js development server after running 'npm install'.

You'll want to replace the url in 'components/apollo.ts' - ran out of time.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
